# Aviation Risk Analysis and Recommendations

This project explores aviation accident data to identify low-risk aircraft for a new business venture into the aviation industry. Using data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, actionable insights are provided to assist business stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## Business Understanding

The company is expanding into the aviation industry and needs to understand the risks associated with operating different types of aircraft. 

### Key Objectives:
1. Determine which aircraft have the lowest risk based on historical data.
2. Provide actionable insights to guide the purchase of aircraft.
3. Deliver recommendations to support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Description

The dataset used is from the [National Transportation Safety Board](#) (1962-2023). It includes aviation accident data covering civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

### Key Variables:
- **Aircraft Type**: The model/type of aircraft involved in incidents.
- **Accident Severity**: Classification of accidents (e.g., fatal, minor).
- **Date and Location**: Time and location of the incidents.
- **Cause**: Contributing factors to the incident (e.g., mechanical failure, human error).

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values using imputation and exclusion methods.
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Filtered data to include only relevant aircraft and accidents.

## Results

### Recommendations:
1. **Aircraft A**: Low accident frequency and minor severity; suitable for initial investment.
2. **Aircraft B**: Excellent safety record for commercial use; recommended for larger-scale operations.
3. **Aircraft C**: Moderate risk but efficient for private enterprises; consider as a secondary option.
